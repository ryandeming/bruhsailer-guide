        <h1>Bruhsailer Ironman Guide: Part 1</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1: Get to da chopper earth staves</h2>
        <p>This guide has three chapters, each of which is split into multiple sections. You can find the links to the chapters at the end of each chapter, along with a link to a sheet giving the stats and GP that you will have at each and every step. The full guide is very long and will progress your account to good stats for future progression in an efficient manner. If you are looking to start an ironman account but donâ€™t want a very long guide, every section end(/start) is a very reasonable moment to pause your progression and divert.</p>
